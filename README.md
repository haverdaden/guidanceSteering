# Guidance Steering for Farming Simulator 19

## Warning!
Please be aware that this is a ***DEVELOPMENT VERSION***!

If you are planning to use a copy of the current development branch, please understand that the development version can break the game!

[Latest BETA release](https://github.com/stijnwop)

## How the basics works
Be aware that this version doesnÂ´t support the full feature package yet!

### Buying GPS
To be able to use the GPS you first need to buy the technology for your vehicle. Either buy a new vehicle and add the GPS or drive your current vehicle to the shop and add it.

#### Open the menu
In order to open the menu hit ctrl + s.

##### Setup your AB line
Drive to the location you want to setup your lines.

Hit alt + e once in order to reset the AB creation.

Hit alt + e once more in order to set point A.

Hit alt + e once more in order to set point B which will create the track!

#### Auto width
Hit alt + r in order to calculate the width of your vehicle.

Tip: unfold and lower the vehicle in order to get the best results!

#### Increase/descrease width
Hit alt + plus and minus in order to change the width

***_Please note that this only works after the track creation!_***

#### Terrain angle snapping
If you're not able to create straight lines yourself you can enable angle snapping in the menu. This will align the AB lines with the terrain.

#### Toggle guidance steering
Once a track is created hit alt + x to toggle the steering.

#### Headland control
Currently it auto stops at the headland when cruise control is enabled. This feature and headland turning is still being worked on.

## MP
This version should work in MP, but keep in mind it might have bugs.

### Dev tips:
To quickly zip the dev mod without the needed extra's, use the zip.bat. 

***_Please note: the zip.bat requires the application 7zip to be installed!_***
